His works , diverse in form and multifaceted , make Jan Carew an important intellectual of the Caribbean world . His poetry and his first two novels , Black Midas and The Wild Coast ( both published in 1958 by Secker & Warburg in London ) , were significant landmarks of the West Indian literature then attempting to cope with its colonial past and assert its wish for autonomy . He worked with the late President Cheddi Jagan in the fight for Guianese independence . Carew also played an important part in the Black movement gaining strength in England and North America , publishing reviews and newspapers , producing programs and plays for the radio and the television . His scholarly research drove him to question traditional historiographies and the prevailing historical models of the conquest of America . The way he reframed Christopher Columbus as an historical character outside his mythical hagiography became a necessary path in his mind to build anew the Caribbean world on sounder foundations .\",\n",
