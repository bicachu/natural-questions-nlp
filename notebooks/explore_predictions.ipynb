The small intestine has three distinct regions -- the duodenum , jejunum , and ileum . The duodenum is the shortest part of the small intestine and is where preparation for absorption begins . It also receives bile and pancreatic juice through the pancreatic duct , controlled by the sphincter of Oddi . The primary function of the small intestine is the absorption of nutrients and minerals from food , using small finger - like protrusions called villi .\",\n",
